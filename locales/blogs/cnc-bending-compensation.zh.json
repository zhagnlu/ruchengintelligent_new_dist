  "Understanding Press Brake Compensation": "了解压力刹车补偿",
  "When bending long workpieces on a CNC press brake, the machine bed tends to deflect under pressure, resulting in uneven bending angles across the length of the part. Compensation systems counteract this deflection to ensure uniform bend angles.": "在数控压力机制动器上弯曲长工件时，机床床身倾向于在压力下偏转，导致整个零件长度的弯曲角度不均匀。补偿系统抵消这种偏转，以确保均匀的弯曲角度。",
  "Mechanical Compensation (Crowning)": "机械补偿（加冕）",
  "Mechanical compensation, also known as crowning, uses wedge-shaped blocks that can be adjusted to create a convex curve in the bed. This pre-compensates for the deflection that will occur during bending.": "机械补偿，也称为加冕，使用楔形块，可以调整以在床上形成凸曲线。这预先补偿了弯曲过程中发生的挠度。",
  "Advantages:": "优势：",
  "Simple, reliable mechanism with few moving parts": "简单、可靠的机构，运动部件少",
  "Lower initial cost compared to hydraulic systems": "与液压系统相比，初始成本更低",
  "Minimal maintenance requirements": "最低维护要求",
  "No hydraulic fluid or electrical components to maintain": "无需维护的液压油或电气部件",
  "Disadvantages:": "劣势：",
  "Manual adjustment required for different workpiece lengths": "不同工件长度需要手动调整",
  "Less precise than hydraulic compensation": "不如液压补偿精确",
  "Cannot be adjusted during the bending process": "弯曲过程中无法调整",
  "Hydraulic Compensation": "液压补偿",
  "Hydraulic compensation systems use hydraulic cylinders positioned along the bed to actively compensate for deflection. The CNC control calculates the required compensation based on material properties, bend length, and tonnage.": "液压补偿系统使用沿床定位的液压缸来主动补偿偏转。CNC控制根据材料特性、弯曲长度和吨位计算所需补偿。",
  "Automatic compensation adjusted for each bend": "为每个弯曲调整的自动补偿",
  "Higher precision and consistency": "更高的精度和一致性",

  "Which Compensation System to Choose?": "选择哪种薪酬制度？",
  "Your choice depends on several factors:": "您的选择取决于几个因素：",
  "Production Volume: High-volume operations benefit from the automation of hydraulic compensation": "产量：大批量运营受益于液压补偿的自动化",
  "Part Variety: Frequent changes in part length favor hydraulic systems": "零件品种：零件长度的频繁变化有利于液压系统",
  "Precision Requirements: Tight tolerances require hydraulic compensation": "精度要求：紧公差需要液压补偿",
  "Budget: Mechanical compensation offers good value for simpler applications": "预算：机械补偿为更简单的应用提供了良好的价值",
