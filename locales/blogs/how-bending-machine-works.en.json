  "A bending machine works by applying controlled force to a metal sheet placed between a punch (upper tool) and a die (lower tool). When the punch descends, it forces the metal into the die cavity, creating a precise bend. The bending process follows the principles of plastic deformation, where the metal is permanently shaped without breaking.": "A bending machine works by applying controlled force to a metal sheet placed between a punch (upper tool) and a die (lower tool).
