  "When bending long workpieces on a CNC press brake, the machine bed tends to deflect under pressure, resulting in uneven bending angles across the length of the part. Compensation systems counteract this deflection to ensure uniform bend angles.": "When bending long workpieces on a CNC press brake, the machine bed tends to deflect under pressure, resulting in uneven bending angles across the length of the part.
