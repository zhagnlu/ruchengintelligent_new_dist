  "\"Scimitar\" or \"saber\" refers to an offset, curved profile design similar to the curved blade of a scimitar\n            sword.

Complete operation manuals and video tutorials are also provided.": "是的，我们提供全面的支持，包括现场安装、机器调试和操作员培训（通常为 3-5 天）。",
  "Yes, we provide comprehensive support including on-site installation, machine commissioning, foundation requirements guidance,\n            and operator training. Training covers machine operation, PLC programming, die setup, pressure adjustment,\n            safety protocols, basic maintenance, and troubleshooting. Complete operation manuals and technical documentation are also provided.": "是的，我们提供全面的支持，包括现场安装、机器调试、基础要求指导和操作员培训。",
  "Yes, we specialize in custom radius tooling for unique applications. Provide your required radius\n            dimensions, material specifications, production volume, and part drawings. Our engineering team will\n            design custom arc molds optimized for your specific application. Custom tooling is particularly\n            cost-effective for high-volume production runs requiring consistent radius specifications not available\n            in standard tooling catalogs.": "是的，我们专注于为独特应用提供定制半径工具。",
  "Yes, we specialize in custom tooling for unique bending applications. Provide us with your part drawings,\n            material specifications, and bend requirements. Our engineering team will design custom dies for U-channels,\n            Z-profiles, radius bends, offset bends, or any special geometry. Custom tooling ensures consistent results\n            for high-volume production runs.": "是的，我们专注于为独特的弯曲应用提供定制工具。",
  "Yes, with the optional bevel cutting head upgrade, our tube laser can cut various bevel angles for pipe\n            welding preparation. The system can create V-grooves, K-grooves, and other weld joint configurations at\n            precise angles. This eliminates the need for secondary beveling operations and ensures perfect fit-up for\n            welding. The SmartCut AI system automatically calculates optimal cutting paths for complex bevel geometries.": "是的，通过可选的坡口切割头升级，我们的管激光器可以切割各种坡口角度，以进行管道焊接准备。",
  "Yes, with the optional conical rolling attachment, our machines can produce conical shapes by adjusting\n            the roll positions to create a gradual taper. The CNC system calculates the required roll positions for\n            the desired cone angle. This capability is particularly useful for manufacturing hoppers, funnels, and\n            conical sections for pressure vessels. Standard cylindrical machines can be retrofitted with this option.": "是的，借助可选的锥形滚动附件，我们的机器可以通过调整滚动位置以形成逐渐的锥度来生产锥形形状。 "
