  "Bump forming uses standard V-dies and punches with CNC programming to create large radius arcs through multiple small incremental bends (approximating the arc with linear segments). Dedicated radius tooling uses specially profiled punches and dies to create smooth radius bends in a single operation. Bump forming is cost-effective for occasional large radius work, while dedicated radius tooling provides superior surface finish and faster production for regular radius bending applications.": "凸块成形使用标准 V 型模具和冲头，通过 CNC 编程通过多个小增量弯曲创建大半径圆弧（用线性段近似圆弧）。",
  "Use urethane dies when bending pre-finished, pre-painted, or polished materials where surface marking is unacceptable. Urethane provides mar-free bending ideal for architectural panels, appliances, decorative metalwork, and any application where surface quality is critical. Steel dies are preferred for higher production volumes, harder materials, or when surface marking isn't a concern. Hybrid steel-urethane combines both benefits.": "在弯曲预加工、预涂漆或抛光材料（表面标记不可接受）时，请使用聚氨酯模具。",
  "The punch radius should be at least 63% of material thickness to prevent stress concentration. For air bending, the internal radius forms at approximately 15-20% of the V-die opening width. Match your punch tip radius to the natural internal radius created by the die opening for consistent angles. Consider material springback (stainless steel requires 1-2° compensation). Consult our technical team with your material specifications for optimal radius selection.": "冲头半径应至少为材料厚度的 63%，以防止应力集中。",
  "Yes, we specialize in custom radius tooling for unique applications. Provide your required radius dimensions, material specifications, production volume, and part drawings. Our engineering team will design custom arc molds optimized for your specific application. Custom tooling is particularly cost-effective for high-volume production runs requiring consistent radius specifications not available in standard tooling catalogs.": "是的，我们专注于为独特应用提供定制半径工具。",
  "Maximum achievable radius depends on press brake table width and tooling system. Standard radius punches typically range from R5 to R100mm. Large radius tooling systems can achieve R120-R200mm. For radii exceeding these limits, bump forming can create virtually any radius through programmed multi-step bending. Large radius applications may require specialized extended-reach tooling or custom engineered solutions.": "可实现的最大半径取决于折弯机工作台宽度和工具系统。",
  "Springback increases with material hardness and decreases with larger bend radius. To minimize springback: use properly matched punch radius (63% minimum of material thickness), apply sufficient tonnage for bottom bending rather than air bending, compensate bend angle 1-2° for stainless steel, use larger die opening to reduce stress, and consider coining for zero springback applications. Material-specific springback tables help predict and compensate for springback in production.": "回弹随着材料硬度的增加而增加，并随着弯曲半径的增大而减小。",
