  "The general rule is to use a V-die opening that is 8 times the material thickness (8T rule). For example, 2mm thick material requires a 16mm die opening. This ratio ensures proper bend formation, prevents cracking, and maintains consistent bend angles. Thicker materials or harder metals may require wider die openings.": "The general rule is to use a V-die opening that is 8 times the material thickness (8T rule).
