  "Chromium molybdenum steel (42CrMo, Cr12MoV) is the industry standard, offering exceptional strength, wear resistance, and corrosion protection. For heavy-duty applications or extended tool life, premium HSS (high-speed steel) or carbide materials can be specified. The material choice depends on production volume, material being bent, and required tool life.": "铬钼钢（42CrMo、Cr12MoV）是行业标准，具有卓越的强度、耐磨性和腐蚀保护。",
  "The general rule is to use a V-die opening that is 8 times the material thickness (8T rule). For example, 2mm thick material requires a 16mm die opening. This ratio ensures proper bend formation, prevents cracking, and maintains consistent bend angles. Thicker materials or harder metals may require wider die openings.": "一般规则是使用 8 倍材料厚度的 V 型模具开口（8T 规则）。",
  "Standard press brake tooling typically has a hardness of HRC 45-52, which provides excellent wear resistance while maintaining toughness to prevent cracking. For demanding applications or hard materials (stainless steel, high-tensile steel), tooling with HRC 54-58 hardness is recommended. Higher hardness extends tool life but requires careful handling to avoid chipping.": "标准折弯机模具的硬度通常为 HRC 45-52，可提供出色的耐磨性，同时保持韧性以防止破裂。",
  "Yes, we specialize in custom tooling for unique bending applications. Provide us with your part drawings, material specifications, and bend requirements. Our engineering team will design custom dies for U-channels, Z-profiles, radius bends, offset bends, or any special geometry. Custom tooling ensures consistent results for high-volume production runs.": "是的，我们专注于为独特的弯曲应用提供定制工具。",
  "Tool life depends on material being bent, bending frequency, tonnage applied, and maintenance. Quality heat-treated tooling can last 100,000+ bends for mild steel. Stainless steel or high-tensile materials reduce tool life. Proper maintenance (cleaning, storage, periodic inspection) and correct die selection maximize longevity. Worn tooling can be reground to restore performance.": "刀具寿命取决于弯曲材料、弯曲频率、施加的吨位和维护。",
  "European tooling (Wila, Amada, Trumpf systems) uses segmented quick-change tooling with standardized clamping systems for rapid setup. American-style tooling typically uses full-length dies with mechanical or hydraulic clamping. European systems offer greater flexibility and faster changeover, while American systems provide robust, economical solutions. We manufacture tooling compatible with both standards.": "欧洲模具（Wila、Amada、Trumpf 系统）使用分段快速更换模具和标准化夹紧系统来实现快速安装。",
