  "Common questions about gooseneck and scimitar press brake tooling": "有关鹅颈和弯刀折弯机模具的常见问题",
  "A gooseneck punch features a deep relief design (offset profile) that provides clearance for existing flanges and deep box geometries. Standard straight 90° punches would cause interference when trying to form channels or parts with return flanges. Gooseneck punches enable multi-bend operations by preventing the punch from hitting previously formed flanges, making them essential for box forming, door frames, and channel bending applications.": "鹅颈冲头采用深浮雕设计（偏置轮廓），可为现有法兰和深盒几何形状提供间隙。",
  "\"Scimitar\" or \"saber\" refers to an offset, curved profile design similar to the curved blade of a scimitar sword. In press brake tooling, scimitar punches feature an offset geometry that allows for complex channel formations and Z-bends. When combined with gooseneck design, it creates a specialized tool providing both deep relief clearance and offset capability for the most challenging box and channel forming operations.": "“弯刀”或“军刀”是指类似于弯刀剑的弯曲刀片的偏置弯曲轮廓设计。",
  "Throat depth should be determined by the return flange length you need to form. Measure the distance from the bend line to the edge of your existing flange, then add clearance (typically 3-5mm). For channels formed in two strokes, the throat depth determines the maximum channel depth. Provide us with your part drawings showing flange dimensions, and our engineering team will recommend the optimal throat depth and face width for your application.": "喉部深度应根据您需要形成的回流法兰长度来确定。",
  "Yes, acute angle gooseneck punches (30°, 45°, 60°) are specifically designed for hemming and acute bending operations where deep relief clearance is required. These combine the interference-free benefits of gooseneck design with sharp tip geometry for hemming. Two-stage hemming operations (acute bend followed by flattening) can be performed even on parts with existing flanges using specialized gooseneck hemming tooling.": "是的，锐角鹅颈冲头（30°、45°、60°）专为需要深浮雕间隙的卷边和锐角弯曲操作而设计。",
  "Standard gooseneck punches are manufactured from T10A, 42CrMo, or Cr12MoV alloy steel with quenching hardness of HRC 47±2. This hardness provides excellent wear resistance while maintaining toughness to prevent cracking in the deep relief geometry. For high-volume production or hard materials (stainless steel, high-tensile steel), optional induction hardening or Nitrex® surface treatment can increase surface hardness while maintaining core toughness.": "标准鹅颈冲头采用T10A、42CrMo或Cr12MoV合金钢制造，淬火硬度为HRC 47±2。",
  "Absolutely. We specialize in custom-engineered gooseneck punches designed to your exact specifications. Provide part drawings showing flange dimensions, bend angles, material specifications, and production volume. Our engineering team will design custom gooseneck tooling optimized for your specific application, including unique throat depths, compound angles, radius bends, or specialized clearance features. Custom tooling is particularly cost-effective for high-volume production of proprietary box and channel designs.": "绝对地。",
