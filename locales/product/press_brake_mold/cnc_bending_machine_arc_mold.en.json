  "The punch radius should be at least 63% of material thickness to prevent stress concentration. For air bending, the internal radius forms at approximately 15-20% of the V-die opening width. Match your punch tip radius to the natural internal radius created by the die opening for consistent angles. Consider material springback (stainless steel requires 1-2° compensation).

  "Maximum achievable radius depends on press brake table width and tooling system. Standard radius punches typically range from R5 to R100mm. Large radius tooling systems can achieve R120-R200mm. For radii exceeding these limits, bump forming can create virtually any radius through programmed multi-step bending.

  "Springback increases with material hardness and decreases with larger bend radius. To minimize springback: use properly matched punch radius (63% minimum of material thickness), apply sufficient tonnage for bottom bending rather than air bending, compensate bend angle 1-2° for stainless steel, use larger die opening to reduce stress, and consider coining for zero springback applications. Material-specific springback tables help predict and compensate for springback in production.": "Springback increases with material hardness and decreases with larger bend radius.
