  "Depending on tonnage and material type, heavy-duty press brakes can bend mild steel up to 50mm thick, stainless steel up to 30mm, and aluminum up to 40mm. The exact capacity depends on the machine tonnage, working length, and material properties.": "根据吨位和材料类型，重型折弯机可以弯曲厚度达 50 毫米的低碳钢、厚度达 30 毫米的不锈钢和厚度达 40 毫米的铝。",
  "The automatic crowning system compensates for frame deflection by adjusting the table curvature. It uses CNC-controlled hydraulic or mechanical wedges to create a slight convex curve in the table, counteracting the natural bowing that occurs under heavy loads, ensuring consistent angle across the entire bend length.": "自动凸度系统通过调整工作台曲率来补偿框架偏转。",
  "Yes, heavy-duty press brakes are specifically designed for continuous industrial production. They feature oversized cooling systems, industrial-grade components, and robust construction to handle 24/7 operation. Regular maintenance schedules should be followed to ensure optimal performance.": "是的，重型折弯机专为连续工业生产而设计。",
  "Heavy-duty press brakes require reinforced concrete foundations due to their significant weight and operational forces. Foundation specifications vary by machine size but typically require 500-800mm thick concrete pads with proper reinforcement. We provide detailed foundation drawings with each machine.": "由于重型折弯机的重量和操作力很大，因此需要钢筋混凝土基础。",
  "Heavy-duty press brakes are typically custom-engineered to specifications. Lead time ranges from 90-180 days depending on tonnage, configuration, and optional features. Rush delivery may be available for certain configurations.": "重型折弯机通常根据规格进行定制设计。",
  "We provide a comprehensive 3-year warranty on heavy-duty machines covering all major components. This includes on-site installation, commissioning, operator training, and 24/7 technical support. Extended warranty packages and preventive maintenance programs are available.": "我们为重型机器提供涵盖所有主要部件的全面 3 年保修。",
