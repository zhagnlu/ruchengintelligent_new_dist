  "Guillotine shears use a vertical blade motion that descends straight down, providing higher precision and the ability to cut thicker materials. They produce minimal material waste and are ideal for applications requiring high accuracy. Swing beam shears use an arc-shaped cutting motion, offer a smaller footprint, and are better suited for thinner materials.": "Guillotine shears use a vertical blade motion that descends straight down, providing higher precision and the ability to cut thicker materials. They produce minimal material waste and are ideal for applications requiring high accuracy.
