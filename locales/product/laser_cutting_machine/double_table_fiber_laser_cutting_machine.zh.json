  "Double table machines typically achieve 40-50% higher productivity than single table machines. The automatic table exchange takes only rapid, and while one table is cutting, the operator can load/unload the other table simultaneously. This eliminates material loading downtime and enables continuous 24/7 operation, making it ideal for high-volume production environments.": "双工作台机器的生产率通常比单工作台机器高 40-50%。",
  "Our fiber laser cutting machines can cut various thicknesses of carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and 12mm, and copper/brass up to 8mm (thicknesses vary based on laser power). Higher wattage lasers can cut thicker materials. The machines handle various metals including mild steel, stainless steel, galvanized steel, aluminum alloys, copper, brass, and titanium.": "我们的光纤激光切割机可以切割各种厚度的碳钢、不锈钢、铝和 12 毫米，以及最大 8 毫米的铜/黄铜（厚度根据激光功率而变化）。",
  "Fiber lasers are nearly maintenance-free compared to CO2 lasers. Regular maintenance includes: cleaning protective lenses weekly, checking water chiller levels, inspecting gas pressure, and cleaning dust extraction filters. The fiber laser source itself requires no maintenance and has a lifespan of 100,000+ hours. No laser gas refills or mirror alignments are needed.": "与 CO2 激光器相比，光纤激光器几乎无需维护。",
