  "Common questions about our plate rolling machines": "有关卷板机的常见问题",
  "3-roll machines are more economical and suitable for general applications, but require pre-bending the leading edge separately and may leave longer straight edges. 4-roll machines offer higher precision and efficiency with integrated pre-bending capability, allowing edge bending without removing the plate. They produce shorter remaining straight edges and eliminate flat spots, making them ideal for high-precision work and thick plate rolling.": "三辊机器更经济，适合一般应用，但需要单独预弯曲前缘，并且可能会留下较长的直边。 ",
  "Our plate rolling machines can process carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum alloys, and other ductile metals. Different models are available to handle various plate thicknesses. The actual bending performance depends on material ductility, hardness, and yield strength. Softer materials and those with higher ductility are easier to roll to smaller diameters.": "我们的卷板机可以加工碳钢、不锈钢、铝合金和其他延展性金属。",
  "Our CNC-controlled plate rolling machines achieve high bending precision for diameter consistency. The CNC system allows precise control of roll positions and automatically calculates the correct settings based on plate thickness and desired radius. Digital feedback systems monitor the rolling process in real-time to maintain consistent quality throughout the operation.": "我们的 CNC 控制卷板机可实现高弯曲精度，确保直径一致性。 ",
  "Pre-bending is the process of bending the leading and trailing edges of the plate before the main rolling operation. This prevents flat spots on the finished cylinder and reduces the remaining straight edge. Our 4-roll machines have integrated pre-bending capability, allowing you to pre-bend edges without removing and reinserting the plate, which saves time and improves quality.": "预弯是在主轧制操作之前弯曲板材前缘和后缘的过程。",
  "Regular maintenance includes checking hydraulic oil levels and quality, inspecting roll surfaces for wear, lubricating bearings and moving parts, and verifying alignment of the roll system. The hydraulic system should be serviced annually with oil changes and filter replacements. With proper maintenance, our machines are designed for 20+ years of reliable service. We provide comprehensive maintenance manuals and training with each machine.": "定期维护包括检查液压油油位和质量、检查辊表面的磨损情况、润滑轴承和运动部件以及验证辊系统的对准情况。",
  "Yes, with the optional conical rolling attachment, our machines can produce conical shapes by adjusting the roll positions to create a gradual taper. The CNC system calculates the required roll positions for the desired cone angle. This capability is particularly useful for manufacturing hoppers, funnels, and conical sections for pressure vessels. Standard cylindrical machines can be retrofitted with this option.": "是的，借助可选的锥形滚动附件，我们的机器可以通过调整滚动位置以形成逐渐的锥度来生产锥形形状。 ",
