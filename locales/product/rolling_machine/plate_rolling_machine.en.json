  "3-roll machines are more economical and suitable for general applications, but require pre-bending the leading edge separately and may leave longer straight edges. 4-roll machines offer higher precision and efficiency with integrated pre-bending capability, allowing edge bending without removing the plate. They produce shorter remaining straight edges and eliminate flat spots, making them ideal for high-precision work and thick plate rolling.": "3-roll machines are more economical and suitable for general applications, but require pre-bending the leading edge separately and may leave longer straight edges. 4-roll machines offer higher precision and efficiency with integrated pre-bending capability, allowing edge bending without removing the plate.

  "Our plate rolling machines can process carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum alloys, and other ductile metals. Different models are available to handle various plate thicknesses. The actual bending performance depends on material ductility, hardness, and yield strength. Softer materials and those with higher ductility are easier to roll to smaller diameters.": "Our plate rolling machines can process carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum alloys, and other ductile metals.

  "Pre-bending is the process of bending the leading and trailing edges of the plate before the main rolling operation. This prevents flat spots on the finished cylinder and reduces the remaining straight edge. Our 4-roll machines have integrated pre-bending capability, allowing you to pre-bend edges without removing and reinserting the plate, which saves time and improves quality.": "Pre-bending is the process of bending the leading and trailing edges of the plate before the main rolling operation.

  "Regular maintenance includes checking hydraulic oil levels and quality, inspecting roll surfaces for wear, lubricating bearings and moving parts, and verifying alignment of the roll system. The hydraulic system should be serviced annually with oil changes and filter replacements. With proper maintenance, our machines are designed for 20+ years of reliable service. We provide comprehensive maintenance manuals and training with each machine.": "Regular maintenance includes checking hydraulic oil levels and quality, inspecting roll surfaces for wear, lubricating bearings and moving parts, and verifying alignment of the roll system.

  "Yes, with the optional conical rolling attachment, our machines can produce conical shapes by adjusting the roll positions to create a gradual taper. The CNC system calculates the required roll positions for the desired cone angle. This capability is particularly useful for manufacturing hoppers, funnels, and conical sections for pressure vessels. Standard cylindrical machines can be retrofitted with this option.": "Yes, with the optional conical rolling attachment, our machines can produce conical shapes by adjusting the roll positions to create a gradual taper.
