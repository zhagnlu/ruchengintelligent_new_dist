  "Blade life varies significantly based on wood type, material diameter, presence of dirt/rocks, and maintenance practices. In clean wood applications, chromium steel blades typically last 150-300 hours of continuous operation. Carbide-inlay blades can last 800-1200 hours when avoiding metal contaminants. Proper blade maintenance, rotation, and avoiding dirt-contaminated wood maximize blade life.": "Blade life varies significantly based on wood type, material diameter, presence of dirt/rocks, and maintenance practices.

  "Yes, chipper blades can be professionally sharpened multiple times before replacement. Most blades can be resharpened 3-6 times depending on wear severity and original blade thickness. Professional sharpening services restore proper bevel angle and edge geometry. Regular sharpening before severe dulling occurs maximizes total blade life and maintains optimal chip quality.

  "Signs include larger chip sizes, increased power consumption, excessive fines or dust, visible edge rounding or nicks, and increased feeding force required. Inspect blades every 50-100 operating hours for wear. Replace or sharpen when cutting edge shows significant rounding or if nicks exceed 3mm depth. Rotating blade positions during inspection helps ensure even wear across all cutting edges.": "Signs include larger chip sizes, increased power consumption, excessive fines or dust, visible edge rounding or nicks, and increased feeding force required.

  "For occasional use with clean wood, carbon steel offers good value. For professional/commercial operations, chromium steel (8%+ Cr) provides the best balance of performance and cost. For high-volume production or abrasive applications, consider premium tool steels. Carbide-inlay blades are recommended for maximum productivity in continuous operations despite higher initial cost.
