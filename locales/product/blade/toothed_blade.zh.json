  "Common questions about toothed blades": "关于齿形刀片的常见问题",
  "Tooth pitch selection depends on your desired tear strength and perforation quality. Smaller pitch (closer teeth) creates easier tear-off with lower strength. Larger pitch provides stronger material between perforations. Our engineering team can recommend optimal pitch based on material type, thickness, and end-use requirements. Sample testing is available to verify performance.": "齿距的选择取决于您所需的撕裂强度和穿孔质量。",
  "Toothed blades can perforate paper, cardboard, plastic films, laminates, foils, textiles, and specialty materials. Material capability depends on blade material and tooth design. HSS blades handle most paper and plastic applications. Carbide blades are recommended for abrasive materials, coated substrates, or high-volume production requiring extended blade life.": "带齿刀片可以对纸张、纸板、塑料薄膜、层压板、箔片、纺织品和特种材料进行穿孔。",
  "Blade life varies significantly based on material processed, production speed, and tooth design. HSS blades typically last from hundreds of thousands to millions of linear feet in paper applications. Carbide blades can last 5-10 times longer than HSS. Proper setup, blade pressure, and regular inspection maximize blade life. We provide expected life estimates based on your specific application.": "刀片寿命根据加工材料、生产速度和齿设计而有很大差异。",
  "Some toothed blade designs can be re-sharpened, while others are designed for replacement. Rotary toothed blades with simple tooth profiles can often be professionally re-ground. Complex tooth patterns or very fine pitches typically require replacement. Re-sharpening feasibility depends on original tooth depth, wear patterns, and dimensional requirements. We offer evaluation services to determine if re-sharpening is cost-effective.": "一些齿形刀片设计可以重新磨锐，而另一些则设计用于更换。",
  "For accurate custom quotes, provide: blade outer diameter, inner diameter (bore size), hub thickness, desired tooth pitch, tooth profile type if known, material being processed, material thickness, production speed, and any special requirements. Technical drawings or samples of existing blades are extremely helpful. Our team can work from minimal information to develop complete specifications.": "如需准确的定制报价，请提供：叶片外径、内径（孔径）、轮毂厚度、所需齿距、齿形类型（如果已知）、正在加工的材料、材料厚度、生产速度和任何特殊要求。",
  "Yes, we offer sample blade production and testing services for custom applications. Sample blades allow you to verify perforation quality, tear strength, and production performance before committing to full production quantities. Sample fees are often credited toward production orders. This service is especially recommended for new applications or challenging materials.": "是的，我们为定制应用提供样品叶片生产和测试服务。",
