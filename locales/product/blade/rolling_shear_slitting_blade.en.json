  "Blade life depends on material being cut, cutting speed, and maintenance practices. Our HSS blades typically last 5-10 times longer than standard blades. In metal slitting applications, expect hundreds of thousands of linear meters before re-sharpening is needed. Proper lubrication and regular inspection extend blade life significantly.": "Blade life depends on material being cut, cutting speed, and maintenance practices.
