  "Blade life depends on material being cut, thickness, frequency of use, and maintenance. With four usable edges, our blades can last 4 times longer than single-edge blades. Typical service life ranges from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of cuts. Proper blade gap adjustment and regular rotation extend blade life significantly.": "刀片寿命取决于被切割的材料、厚度、使用频率和维护。",
  "Our shearing blades can cut mild steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper, brass, and other metal alloys. The maximum cutting thickness depends on material hardness and machine capacity. Standard blades handle materials up to 50mm thick in mild steel. For harder materials like stainless steel, specialized blade materials are recommended.": "我们的剪切刀片可以切割低碳钢、不锈钢、铝、铜、黄铜和其他金属合金。",
  "Signs include increased burring, rough cut edges, visible nicks or chips in the cutting edge, increased cutting force required, or material deformation. When these occur, rotate the blade to use a fresh edge. Replace when all four edges show significant wear. Regular visual inspection after every shift helps maintain optimal cutting quality.": "迹象包括毛刺增加、切割边缘粗糙、切割边缘可见的刻痕或碎屑、所需的切割力增加或材料变形。",
  "Blades with minor wear can sometimes be professionally re-ground to restore cutting performance. However, deep nicks, cracks, or severe wear typically require replacement. Re-grinding reduces blade dimensions and may affect machine blade gap settings. We offer professional blade inspection services to determine if re-grinding is cost-effective for your situation.": "有时可以对轻微磨损的刀片进行专业重新研磨以恢复切割性能。",
  "For general mild steel cutting, Cr12MoV or 6CrW2Si provides excellent performance and value. For stainless steel and harder materials, consider high-speed steel (HSS) or tungsten carbide. For high-volume production, premium materials offer better long-term cost-effectiveness despite higher initial cost. Our technical team can recommend optimal materials based on your specific application.": "对于一般低碳钢切削，Cr12MoV 或 6CrW2Si 提供卓越的性能和价值。",
  "Yes, we provide comprehensive installation guidelines, blade gap adjustment procedures, and setup recommendations with every blade order. Our technical support team is available to assist with installation questions, troubleshooting, and optimization. On-site installation services are available for large orders or complex applications.": "是的，我们为每个刀片订单提供全面的安装指南、刀片间隙调整程序和设置建议。",
