  "Blade life depends on material type, crusher speed, and blade material. High-speed steel blades typically last 150-300 hours of continuous operation. Hard alloy (carbide-tipped) blades can reach 800-1200 hours when avoiding metal impurities. Proper maintenance, avoiding metal contaminants, and regular blade inspection maximize service life. We recommend keeping spare blade sets for minimal downtime.": "Blade life depends on material type, crusher speed, and blade material.

  "Flat blades work best for thin-walled products (under 3mm) like bottles and films, offering higher output. Claw type blades are ideal for thick materials and provide aggressive cutting action. Flake type is versatile for general-purpose applications. V type offers precision cutting for specialty materials.

  "Yes, most crusher blades can be professionally resharpened 2-4 times depending on wear severity and blade design. Resharpening restores cutting edges and extends total blade life. However, blades with severe chipping, cracks, or excessive wear should be replaced rather than resharpened. We offer professional blade sharpening services with quick turnaround times and quality guarantees.": "Yes, most crusher blades can be professionally resharpened 2-4 times depending on wear severity and blade design.

  "Signs include increased particle size, uneven granulation, higher power consumption, excessive noise, visible blade damage or rounding, and reduced throughput. Inspect blades every 50-100 operating hours. Replace when cutting edges show significant wear or if output quality declines. Preventive replacement before complete failure minimizes downtime and maintains consistent product quality.": "Signs include increased particle size, uneven granulation, higher power consumption, excessive noise, visible blade damage or rounding, and reduced throughput.

  "For occasional use or soft plastics, high carbon steel provides good value. For commercial operations, 9CrSi or SKD11 alloy steel offers excellent balance of performance and cost. For high-volume production or abrasive materials, consider D2 tool steel or carbide-tipped blades despite higher initial cost - their extended life often provides better total cost of ownership. We can help analyze your specific ROI based on production volume and material type.": "For occasional use or soft plastics, high carbon steel provides good value.
