  "Blade life depends on material being cut, thickness, frequency of use, and maintenance. With four usable edges, our blades can last 4 times longer than single-edge blades. Typical service life ranges from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of cuts. Proper blade gap adjustment and regular rotation extend blade life significantly.": "Blade life depends on material being cut, thickness, frequency of use, and maintenance.

Proper blade gap adjustment and regular rotation extend blade life significantly.",
  "Our shearing blades can cut mild steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper, brass, and other metal alloys. The maximum cutting thickness depends on material hardness and machine capacity. Standard blades handle materials up to 50mm thick in mild steel. For harder materials like stainless steel, specialized blade materials are recommended.": "Our shearing blades can cut mild steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper, brass, and other metal alloys.

For harder materials like stainless steel, specialized blade materials are recommended.",
  "Signs include increased burring, rough cut edges, visible nicks or chips in the cutting edge, increased cutting force required, or material deformation. When these occur, rotate the blade to use a fresh edge. Replace when all four edges show significant wear. Regular visual inspection after every shift helps maintain optimal cutting quality.": "Signs include increased burring, rough cut edges, visible nicks or chips in the cutting edge, increased cutting force required, or material deformation. When these occur, rotate the blade to use a fresh edge. Replace when all four edges show significant wear. Regular visual inspection after every shift helps maintain optimal cutting quality.",
  "Blades with minor wear can sometimes be professionally re-ground to restore cutting performance. However, deep nicks, cracks, or severe wear typically require replacement. Re-grinding reduces blade dimensions and may affect machine blade gap settings.
