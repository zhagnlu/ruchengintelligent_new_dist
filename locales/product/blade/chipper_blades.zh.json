  "Frequently Asked Questions": "常见问题解答",
  "Common questions about wood chipper blades": "关于木材削片机刀片的常见问题",
  "Blade life varies significantly based on wood type, material diameter, presence of dirt/rocks, and maintenance practices. In clean wood applications, chromium steel blades typically last 150-300 hours of continuous operation. Carbide-inlay blades can last 800-1200 hours when avoiding metal contaminants. Proper blade maintenance, rotation, and avoiding dirt-contaminated wood maximize blade life.": "刀片寿命根据木材类型、材料直径、污垢/岩石的存在以及维护实践而有很大差异。",
  "Yes, chipper blades can be professionally sharpened multiple times before replacement. Most blades can be resharpened 3-6 times depending on wear severity and original blade thickness. Professional sharpening services restore proper bevel angle and edge geometry. Regular sharpening before severe dulling occurs maximizes total blade life and maintains optimal chip quality. We offer sharpening services with quick turnaround.": "是的，削片机刀片在更换前可以经过多次专业磨锐。",
  "Signs include larger chip sizes, increased power consumption, excessive fines or dust, visible edge rounding or nicks, and increased feeding force required. Inspect blades every 50-100 operating hours for wear. Replace or sharpen when cutting edge shows significant rounding or if nicks exceed 3mm depth. Rotating blade positions during inspection helps ensure even wear across all cutting edges.": "迹象包括更大的切屑尺寸、增加的功耗、过多的细粉或灰尘、可见的边缘倒圆或刻痕以及所需的进给力增加。",
  "For occasional use with clean wood, carbon steel offers good value. For professional/commercial operations, chromium steel (8%+ Cr) provides the best balance of performance and cost. For high-volume production or abrasive applications, consider premium tool steels. Carbide-inlay blades are recommended for maximum productivity in continuous operations despite higher initial cost. Our team can recommend optimal materials based on your specific usage patterns.": "对于偶尔与清洁木材一起使用的情况，碳钢具有良好的价值。",
  "Check your chipper's operator manual for blade specifications including length, width, thickness, and bolt hole pattern. Measure existing blades if manual is unavailable. Provide chipper brand and model number - we maintain specifications for most major brands (Vermeer, Bandit, Morbark, etc.). Send us photos or measurements of existing blades for confirmation. We can cross-reference and provide exact replacement blades.": "检查削片机的操作手册，了解刀片规格，包括长度、宽度、厚度和螺栓孔图案。",
  "Yes, comprehensive installation instructions, torque specifications, and maintenance guidelines are provided with blade orders. We offer technical support for proper blade installation, adjustment, and troubleshooting. Safety information and best practices documentation are included. Our technical team is available to answer questions about blade installation, sharpening schedules, and performance optimization for your specific application.": "是的，刀片订单中提供了全面的安装说明、扭矩规格和维护指南。",
