  "Tooth pitch selection depends on your desired tear strength and perforation quality. Smaller pitch (closer teeth) creates easier tear-off with lower strength. Larger pitch provides stronger material between perforations. Our engineering team can recommend optimal pitch based on material type, thickness, and end-use requirements. Sample testing is available to verify performance.": "Tooth pitch selection depends on your desired tear strength and perforation quality.

  "Toothed blades can perforate paper, cardboard, plastic films, laminates, foils, textiles, and specialty materials. Material capability depends on blade material and tooth design. HSS blades handle most paper and plastic applications. Carbide blades are recommended for abrasive materials, coated substrates, or high-volume production requiring extended blade life.": "Toothed blades can perforate paper, cardboard, plastic films, laminates, foils, textiles, and specialty materials. Material capability depends on blade material and tooth design. HSS blades handle most paper and plastic applications. Carbide blades are recommended for abrasive materials, coated substrates, or high-volume production requiring extended blade life.",
  "Blade life varies significantly based on material processed, production speed, and tooth design. HSS blades typically last from hundreds of thousands to millions of linear feet in paper applications. Carbide blades can last 5-10 times longer than HSS. Proper setup, blade pressure, and regular inspection maximize blade life. We provide expected life estimates based on your specific application.": "Blade life varies significantly based on material processed, production speed, and tooth design.

  "Some toothed blade designs can be re-sharpened, while others are designed for replacement. Rotary toothed blades with simple tooth profiles can often be professionally re-ground. Complex tooth patterns or very fine pitches typically require replacement. Re-sharpening feasibility depends on original tooth depth, wear patterns, and dimensional requirements. We offer evaluation services to determine if re-sharpening is cost-effective.": "Some toothed blade designs can be re-sharpened, while others are designed for replacement.
